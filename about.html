  <p>
    I’m Daniel Whitehouse, a student with a strong interest in economic development, public policy,
    and global inequality. My goal is to understand how economic systems shape people’s lives—and how
    better policy, governance, and international cooperation can improve development outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I plan to pursue graduate study in Economic Development, and this site serves as a place to
    develop my ideas, summarise research, and reflect on topics that matter to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of economics, I’m also involved in community and spiritual activities, and value the role
    of purpose and service in shaping meaningful development work.
