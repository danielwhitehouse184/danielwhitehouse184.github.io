<h1>Why Development Matters</h1>

<p>
Economic development affects opportunity, living standards, health, and long-term wellbeing. 
It determines whether societies can escape poverty, whether governments can provide essential 
services, and whether communities can build resilience against political and economic shocks.
</p>

<p>
This blog is where I explore ideas within development economics—NGOs, governance, inequality, 
policy interventions—and build my understanding as I prepare for future academic study.
